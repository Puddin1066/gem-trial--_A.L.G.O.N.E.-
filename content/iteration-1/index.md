# Echo Pipeline Testing and Execution

This repository is focused on executing and testing the echo pipeline for content generation and processing workflows. The echo pipeline is a comprehensive system designed to handle content generation, transformation, validation, and output formatting.

## Pipeline Overview

The echo pipeline consists of four main components:

1. **Content Generator**: Creates initial content based on input parameters
2. **Content Transformer**: Converts content between different formats (markdown, HTML, JSON-LD)
3. **Quality Validator**: Ensures content meets quality standards and consistency requirements
4. **Output Formatter**: Formats and saves output files with proper metadata

## Testing Framework

The echo pipeline includes a comprehensive testing framework with:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing for each pipeline stage
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pipeline functionality testing
- **Performance Tests**: Load and efficiency testing
- **Quality Tests**: Output validation and consistency checking

## Key Features

- **Multi-Format Support**: Generate content in markdown, HTML, and JSON-LD formats
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in validation for content quality and consistency
- **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics collection and performance tracking
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test suite with detailed reporting
- **Configurable Pipeline**: Flexible configuration for different use cases

## Usage

The pipeline can be executed for content generation or testing:

```bash
# Run content generation
python src/echo_pipeline.py --input input_data.json --iteration 1

# Run test suite
python tests/run_pipeline_tests.py

# Run specific test types
python tests/run_pipeline_tests.py --unit-only
python tests/run_pipeline_tests.py --performance-only
```

## Configuration

Pipeline behavior is controlled through configuration files:

- `config/pipeline_config.yaml`: Main pipeline settings
- `config/test_config.yaml`: Testing parameters
- `config/quality_config.yaml`: Quality assurance settings

## Monitoring and Metrics

The pipeline provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities:

- Real-time execution tracking
- Performance metrics collection
- Quality score monitoring
- Resource usage tracking
- Detailed execution logs
